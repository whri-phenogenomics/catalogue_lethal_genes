In the older girl the genitalia were large enough at the age of 6 months to permit vaginal examination for diagnosis of a left ovarian tumor which was removed soon afterward. The children were mentally precocious. Prognathism and very thick fingernails as well as acanthosis nigricans were also described. Insulin-resistant diabetes developed, and the patients died during childhood of ketoacidosis and intercurrent infections. At necropsy pineal hyperplasia was found in all 3.

Cases probably of the same condition in 2 sisters, offspring of first-cousin parents, were described by Barnes et al. (1974).

There was persistent diffuse erythema of the face, but no blisters or mucous membrane lesions. The typical pattern of lesion development, which occurred over 6 to 8 days and could be induced by moderate rubbing of the skin, began with a reddish spot that expanded with a thin horny collarette at its border; the surface was initially smooth, but later became covered with large grayish scales which flaked off, leaving regenerated background skin. The grayish thickening of her skin progressively diminished after puberty, but the erythematous peeling lesions showed no improvement, although they regressed markedly every summer. The pruritis showed reverse seasonal periodicity, becoming worse in summer. The patient also exhibited moderate uniform palmoplantar keratoderma with chapping, and she had slightly dystrophic fingernails, with some showing definite koilonychia. Her hair appeared grossly normal, and microscopic examination of hair shafts showed no significant changes.

During the following weeks, the child developed tonic seizures that were provoked by tactile stimulation. Although the treatment of seizures was initially effective, after 3.5 months of age the seizures recurred and were often precipitated by extreme emotion. At 4 months of age, a diagnosis for hyperekplexia was made, but therapy with clonazepam was unsuccessful. EEG monitoring coupled with ambulatory video demonstrated that the seizures were both hyperekplectic and epileptic in origin. During the following years, the child suffered from frequent long-lasting seizures accompanied by the arrest and later decline of psychomotor development. Eventually, a progressive epileptic encephalopathy as well as hyperekplexia became evident, and poly-drug treatment failed to provide adequate long-term seizure control. At 4 years of age, the subject was severely retarded and suffered almost daily severe long-lasting fits, both epileptic and nonepileptic in origin, eventually leading to death at the age of 4 years and 4 months]	L4	y	-	lethal	lethal	lethal	L4	L4	post-infant-lethal

A few of the females observed an increase in size of the vascular lesions approximately 1 week before menstruation and a subsequent decrease in size during menstruation. The lesions were present on the face and mucous membranes, including the lips, tongue, cheeks, tonsils, and larynx. Some members had venous malformations within internal organs. One developed 2 vascular tumors in the large intestine and required blood transfusions because of excessive bleeding.

The second death involved her younger brother, who collapsed at 12 years of age while skating; during resuscitation he was noted to have several episodes of ventricular tachycardia. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed a mildly prolonged QTc (450 to 490 ms) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with a right bundle branch block (RBBB) morphology and superior axis, indicating a left ventricular origin. ECG showed no structural cardiac anomaly. He remained in a vegetative state until his death from pneumonia 2 years later.

There was no clear neurologic involvement, and brain imaging was normal, although EEG showed mild background abnormalities. Muscle biopsy showed scattered complex IV (COX)-deficient fibers, which suggested generalized muscle dysfunction and was considered a contraindication for heart transplant. There was no liver involvement. She died at age 10 months of cardiac insufficiency. Light microscopy showed histiocytoid cardiomyopathy. Postmortem, 80% of cardiomyocytes and 60% of skeletal muscle fibers were COX-deficient. There was a near-total deficiency of respiratory complex I and IV in the heart, severe complex I and IV deficiency in the brain, and partial complex III deficiency in both tissues; all complexes were unaffected in the liver. These findings indicated a tissue-specific defect in several components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Gotz et al.

There was some neurologic involvement, with staring gaze, periodic stiffness, and abnormal EEG. She died at postnatal day 3, and autopsy showed an enlarged, hypertrophic heart and pulmonary hypoplasia, but no pathologic changes in the brain or liver. There was severe deficiency of complex I and complex IV in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle, but not in the liver.

Atrial septal aneurysms were detected in her 3 affected sisters (II:1, II:7, and II:9); other abnormalities included mild mitral valve prolapse with mitral and pulmonic regurgitation in 1 sister (II:7), and left atrial and ventricular dilatation in another (II:9). One sister (II:7) also had a 3-year-old son (III:11) who was diagnosed with mild left ventricular and right atrial dilatation as well as mild mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation.

The mitral and tricuspid valves were both prolapsed, with thickened and myxomatous leaflets. The proband's 32-year-old mother was diagnosed at age 2 years with bicuspid aortic valve and ventricular septal defect. Echocardiogram in adulthood also showed mild aortic valve stenosis and mildly prolapsing myxomatous mitral and tricuspid valves. The 66-year-old maternal grandmother was diagnosed at age 13 years with mitral regurgitation due to a myxomatous and prolapsed valve, for which she underwent valve replacement at age 22. Echocardiography later showed a myxomatous and prolapsed tricuspid valve, and she also had atrial fibrillation. Family history revealed that the grandmother's first pregnancy resulted in a male stillbirth; autopsy showed bicuspid aortic valve and aortic stenosis, as well as hydrops fetalis / Thienpont et al.

Cardiac abnormalities included interrupted aortic arch, hypoplastic valves, and ventricular septal defect. She developed seizures and sepsis, resulting in death.

Most patients had additional, but highly variable, features. The most severely affected child had microcephaly, severe global developmental delay, arthrogryposis, cone-rod dystrophy, nystagmus, and dysmorphic features. Brain imaging showed cerebral cysts and neuronal migration defects. In contrast, the least severely affected individual had only Wilms tumor and short stature, and was alive at age 43 years with no reported neurologic abnormalities.

At day 23 of life, the patient experienced cardiac arrest; ECG at time of resuscitation showed ventricular fibrillation (VF). An epicardial cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) was implanted, and she experienced 2 appropriate ICD discharges at age 3 years while on propanolol. At age 4, she developed symptomatic hypoglycemia, and the propanolol dose was reduced; however, at age 5, she had hypoglycemic coma and died. Her mother had 3 spontaneous miscarriages and terminated 2 other pregnancies, 1 due to fetal bradycardia and 1 due to spina bifida. In family B, the proband was a 21-month-old boy, born of unrelated Saudi Arabian parents, who had bradycardia (45 to 60 bpm) at 12 hours of life. ECG showed bradycardia and prolonged QTc (660 ms). Treatment with propanolol did not change the QTc duration, and several months later a pacemaker was implanted because of syncope and recurrent 2:1 AV block. At age 21 months, he was doing well without syncope. His parents and nonidentical twin sister were asymptomatic and had normal ECGs with normal QTc intervals. In family D, 5 of 6 sibs experienced sudden death in childhood: the first child had seizures and died at age 6 years; the second at 45 days; the third was asymptomatic at age 13 years; the fourth had fetal bradycardia and exhibited LQTS with 2:1 AV block, and died suddenly at 10 days of life after implantation of an ICD; and the fifth child also had LQTS with 2:1 AV block and died suddenly at age 45 days]	L1	y	y	lethal	lethal	lethal	L1	L1	pre-infant-lethal

He recovered from this episode and showed mild developmental progress, but had additional similar episodes with seizures, developmental regression, and multisystem involvement without evidence of infection; autoantibody screening was normal. He met the diagnostic criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and had features of renal thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
